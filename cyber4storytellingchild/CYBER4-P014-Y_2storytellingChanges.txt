So, once upon a time, the frogs meet his own frog. Then he’s went asleep, and, and he was, and what the frog do? And, and the, the, the boy looked at the cup, and he said, “It’s gone.” Then, then he, he went to find it, and then he got in the jar, and he’s still in there. And then he shouted to see where his frog is, and he shouted again, and he, and he’s not there. So, he was looking everywhere to find his frog, and then the squirrel bite his nose, and he look in there, and he’s not there, so he keep on shouting, and her went back so he don't fall. So, he climb up the thing, and then he’s gone, and then what he’s running to, and then he went to find his frog, but he couldn't be there, so he, he, he fall on this bench.

And, and then he said the pup to, “Shh. Be quiet.” And, and he look under there, then he find it. Now he’s happy. Now he, he all have frog friends, and he take one home to pet, and he was going anywhere, and now the end.
