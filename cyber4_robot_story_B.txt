There once was a boy who had a dog and a small pet frog. He kept the frog in a big jar in his bedroom.

One night while he and his dog were sleeping, the frog climbed out of the jar. The frog jumped out of an open window.

When the boy and the dog woke up the next morning, they saw that the jar was empty.

The boy looked everywhere for the frog. The dog looked for the frog, too. When the dog tried to look in the jar, he got his head stuck in the jar.

The boy called out the open window, "Frog, where are you?"ù The dog leaned out the window with the jar still stuck on his head.

The boy and the dog looked outside for the frog. 

The boy called for the frog in the woods.

He asked an animal if she had seen the frog. But she was grumpy and bit the boy's nose.

The boy looked in a hollow in a tree.

The boy climbed up on a rock and calls again for his frog. He held onto some branches so he wouldn't fall.

But the branches weren't really branches! They were deer antlers. The deer picked up the boy on his head.

The deer started running with the boy still on his head. The dog ran along too. They were getting close to a cliff. 

The deer stopped suddenly. 

The boy and the dog fell over the edge.

There was a pond below. They landed with a splash right on top of one another next to a log.

Then they heard a familiar sound.

The boy told the dog to be very quiet.

They crept up and looked behind a big log.

There they found the boy's pet frog. He had a big mother frog with him.

They had some small baby frogs and one of them jumped toward the boy.

The baby frog liked the boy and wanted to be his new pet. The boy and the dog were happy to have a new pet frog to take home. 

The frogs watched as the boy and his new pet went home. The end.
